# Spray-Printer
A printer for Roblox Spray Paint.

It's self-explanatory in program, but you'll need pydirectinput_rgx, easygui, pynput, and PIL. Everything else used should be built in.
Designed for Python 3.12.2 (if there's a newer version it probably works)

## Usage:
just run it lmao

Larger sprites and more colors will make the print process take longer.

A 16x16 3-color sprite (plus transparency, so an NES sprite) will take around 30 seconds.
